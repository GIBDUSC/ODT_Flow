# ODT Flow Explorer: Exploring Global Multi-scale Human Mobility Data 

Prediction and control of the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 benefits greatly from our growing computing capacity to quantify fine-scale human movement (Hancock et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2020). In response to the soaring needs of human mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic, we extracted the worldwide daily population flows from billions of geotagged tweets and SafeGraph data, and developed an interactive geospatial web portal, called ODT (Origin-Destination-Time) Flow Explorer (http://gis.cas.sc.edu/GeoAnalytics/od.html), that allows researchers to query, aggregate, visualize, and download daily human movement data at various geographic scales (from local to global). This article briefly explains how we extracted of population movement from Twitter and SafeGraph data, demonstrates how the ODT Flow Explorer can be used to query, visualize, and download human mobility data, and discusses the limitations of each dataset.
