# A Scalable Platform for Extracting, Querying, and Sharing Multi-source Multi-Scale Human Mobility

Prediction and control of the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 benefits greatly from our growing computing capacity to quantify fine-scale human movement (Hancock et al., 2014; Kraemer et al., 2020). In response to the soaring needs of human mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic, we extracted the worldwide daily population flows from billions of geotagged tweets and SafeGraph data, and developed an interactive geospatial web portal, called ODT (Origin-Destination-Time) Flow Explorer (http://gis.cas.sc.edu/GeoAnalytics/od.html), that allows researchers to query, aggregate, visualize, and download daily human movement data at various geographic scales (from local to global).

* Explore, visualize, and download the ODT flow data using the ODT Flow Explorer: http://gis.cas.sc.edu/GeoAnalytics/od.html
* Access the ODT flow data programmatically using the ODT Flow REST APIs with Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/GIBDUSC/ODT_Flows/blob/main/ODT%20Flow%20REST%20APIs_Notebook_Tutorial.ipynb
* Learn how to use the Explorer with the Video Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV3AJIVYnSI
